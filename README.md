The fake terminal is stolen from: [Luís Bragança](https://github.com/luisbraganca/fake-terminal-website)
 
Awesome project right here.

## To-Do:

- Future planning:
  - [x] Implement a back button for terminal. (take you back to the main page/parent location).
  - [x] Add custom footer to side navigation bar (for social media).
  - [ ] Implement two keyboard key shortcuts;
    - [ ] Ctrl + L : for clearing the screen.
    - [ ] Ctrl + C : to stop the typewritting.
  - [ ] Fix a bug, cat a file not present makes the terminal hang.
  - [ ] Maybe get some inspirations from the below:
    - [Vintage Screen Effects](https://codepen.io/collection/AeGGxz) 
    - [Terminal Things](https://codepen.io/collection/Mgrkmw)
    - [Web simulation of UbuntuOS](https://github.com/vivek9patel/vivek9patel.github.io), this guy is a beast.
